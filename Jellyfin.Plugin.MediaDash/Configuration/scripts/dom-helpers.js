// MediaDash shared DOM/text helpers. Extracted from configPage.html on 2026-09-23
// (post-06-D follow-up 1a) to unblock full-DOM tab factory extraction
// (createHistoryTab / createRecycleTab / createIssuesTab / createErrorsTab).
// The tab factories close over `esc()` and `STR` today — once both live on
// window.MediaDash.*, each factory can move into its own file.
//
// Same 06-D pattern as page-lifetime.js / api-client.js: served by
// PluginAssetController, consumed via <script src>, loaded by
// tools/comprehensive-test/ui-lifecycle-self-tests.js via fs+vm.
